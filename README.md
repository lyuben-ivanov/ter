# ter
A set of resources for teaching introductory economic models with R and R Studio. 

In order to get started with the package you need to have R installed. In order to get the most of this package you should have R Studio installed as well. 

Currently the installation requires the package ```devtools``` or the package ```remotes``` (whichever is available on your system): 

```
devtools::install_github("lyuben-ivanov/ter")

remotes::install_github("lyuben-ivanov/ter")
```

In order to learn about the features of the functions included in the package you should try running the function ```ppf_workbook()```. It downloads an R Notebook with interactive exercises that demonstrate the features of the ```ppf_plot()``` function.
